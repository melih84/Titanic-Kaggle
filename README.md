# Titanic-Kaggle

This is one of many solution to the most popular Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This solution includes both
 Random Forest Classifier and XGBooster models with feature engineering and feature selection. I scored 0.76 on the competition with XGBooster.
